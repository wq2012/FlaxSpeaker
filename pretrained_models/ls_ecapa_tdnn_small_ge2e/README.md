> The experiments in those papers were run on Google-internal infrastructure and data, not with this library. **This is a converged small-corpus benchmark checkpoint (2,400 steps / ~13.27 epochs on 5,788 utterances from 232 speakers), not a full-corpus reproduction of the papers' large-scale results** -- see *Training budget* and *Deviations from the source papers* below.

## Training Budget (read this first)

This model was trained to convergence for **2,400 gradient steps** (`S_safe = X + 2 epochs` safety margin, warmup `240` steps) with mini-batches of 32 utterances (8 speakers x 4 utterances), i.e. **~13.27 epochs** over the 5,788-utterance LibriSpeech training pool (232 speakers), on a CPU workstation with seed 42. Across the training trajectory, in-domain LibriSpeech EER progressed from step `400`: **18.13%** (1-utt) / **12.40%** (3-utt) -> step `2000` (knee): **10.47%** (1-utt) / **5.30%** (3-utt) -> step `2400` (final): **10.37%** (1-utt) / **4.90%** (3-utt) (Universal Pooled final: **19.81%** 1-utt / **15.93%** 3-utt). While training loss and validation EER have reached their small-corpus convergence plateau on this 232-speaker open split (<= 25 utterances/speaker), absolute EERs remain bounded by training speaker diversity compared to industrial benchmarks trained on thousands of speakers (see below).

**Training-crop provenance.** This checkpoint was trained with `U(90, 180)`-frame variable-length crops and an exact validity mask (the current pipeline default); the shipped `config.json` / YAML (`variable_length_training: true`) describes the released weights. Step-0 loss fingerprint at the released seed (`scripts/fingerprint_released_checkpoints.py`, `pretrained_models/step0_fingerprints.json`): archived `2.084`; current code with fixed 180-frame crops `2.073`, with `U(90, 180)` crops `2.084` (match: `variable`). Evaluating the released weights with the current code reproduces the archived metrics in `eval_results.json`. At the converged `S_safe` budget, the seed-to-seed standard deviation of pooled 1-utt EER across seeds 0-2 is 0.08-0.41 % absolute (`pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json`), while the 8,000-trial 95 % bootstrap CI half-width is ~0.8 %.

For orientation only: published ECAPA-TDNN systems trained on VoxCeleb2-dev reach about 0.9% EER on the full VoxCeleb1-O list (Desplanques et al., 2020), and sub-1M-parameter systems about 2% (Wang et al., EfficientTDNN, 2022). The checkpoints released here are trained to convergence (including a +2-epoch safety margin) on the self-contained 381-speaker (<=25 utterances/speaker) benchmark corpus rather than VoxCeleb2-dev (5,994 speakers, ~1.1M utterances), and are intended for controlled relative comparisons within the FlaxSpeaker benchmark, not as state-of-the-art models trained on thousand-speaker corpora.

## Model Files Included

- `model.safetensors`: model weights (encoder + GE2E `w,b` / Dr-Vector / PFAS heads) in SafeTensors format
- `flax_model.msgpack`: native Flax Msgpack serialized parameters
- `config.json`: `FlaxSpeakerConfig` (full `ExperimentConfig`, incl. the frontend/VAD settings)
- `eval_results.json`: multi-domain evaluation metrics (1-utt & 3-utt EER, minDCF, ROC-AUC, 95% bootstrap CIs, VoxCeleb1-O 10-speaker subset)
- `model_fp32.tflite` / `model_int8.tflite`: `jax2tf` exports of the **encoder only** with a **fixed, unmasked 180-frame (1.8 s) input window** `[1, 180, 80]` -> `[1, 192]`. All EERs in the main tables below come from full-sequence masked JAX inference (up to 500 frames); the TFLite models see a centre crop and the reported cosine fidelity (>= 0.9999 vs. JAX) was measured on 180-frame inputs.
  - Measured 180-frame TFLite 1-utt EER (librispeech 3,000 1-utt trials (fixed 180-frame unmasked window)): FP32 **11.47%**, INT8 **11.47%**, mean `cos(FP32, INT8)` = `0.999965` (vs. full-sequence <=500-frame masked JAX: `10.37%`)

## Quickstart Usage

### Python API (from Hugging Face Hub or Local Directory)

Requires `flaxspeaker >= 0.4.0` (`pip install -U flaxspeaker`) for full `margin_warmup_steps` config compatibility with the v0.4.0 converged checkpoints (`>= 0.3.0` introduced `load_pretrained`; the legacy `0.2.0` wheel cannot load Hub checkpoints).

```python
from flaxspeaker import load_pretrained

model = load_pretrained("wq2012/ls_ecapa_tdnn_small_ge2e")
emb = model.extract_embedding("path/to/utterance.flac")
score = model.verify("path/to/enroll.flac", "path/to/test.flac")
print(f"Embedding shape: {emb.shape}, Verification score: {score:.4f}")
```

### Command-Line Inference

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --model_dir wq2012/ls_ecapa_tdnn_small_ge2e \
    --enroll_audio path/to/enroll.flac --test_audio path/to/test.flac
```

## Multi-Domain Evaluation Results

### 1-Utterance Verification Across Evaluation Domains

Trial lists are 50/50 target/impostor over held-out speakers (LibriSpeech 40, CN-Celeb2 30, VoxCeleb1 10 speakers); minDCF@0.01 is close to its trivial ceiling of 1.0 for every model under this trial mix.

| Evaluation Split | Trials | EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | minDCF@0.10 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (English Read)** | 3,000 | **10.37%** | [9.27, 11.30] | 0.7433 | 0.4273 | 0.9642 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (Chinese Multi-Genre)** | 3,000 | **29.80%** | [28.00, 31.48] | 0.9640 | 0.9127 | 0.7756 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (In-the-Wild Celebrity)** | 2,000 | **19.75%** | [17.97, 21.58] | 0.9470 | 0.8720 | 0.8845 |
| **Universal Pooled (All 3 Domains)** | 8,000 | **19.81%** | [19.02, 20.82] | 0.9320 | 0.7645 | 0.8825 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3 Domains)** | — | **19.97%** | — | 0.8848 | 0.7373 | 0.8748 |
| **VoxCeleb1-O 10-speaker subset** (see caveat) | 2,500 | **23.92%** | [22.00, 25.81] | 0.8781 | 0.8421 | 0.8503 |

Caveat: VoxCeleb1-O **10-speaker subset**: the official `veri_test2.txt` list filtered to trials whose enrollment and test speakers are both among the 10 held-out evaluation speakers (2,500 trials, ~72% target). **Not comparable to published VoxCeleb1-O numbers**; the other 30 of the 40 official test speakers are used as training data by `vox_*` and `univ_*` models.

### 3-Utterance Multi-Enrollment Verification Across Evaluation Domains

| Evaluation Split | Trials | 3-Utt EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **4.90%** | [3.60, 6.45] | 0.4260 | 0.9874 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **24.80%** | [22.40, 27.60] | 0.8600 | 0.8309 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **15.60%** | [13.60, 17.90] | 0.8080 | 0.9264 |
| **Universal Pooled (3-Utt)** | 3,000 | **15.93%** | [14.43, 17.05] | 0.7927 | 0.9253 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3-Utt)** | — | **15.10%** | — | 0.6980 | 0.9149 |

Single seed; the 95% bootstrap CIs resample trials (not speakers). Differences below about 1% absolute EER between FlaxSpeaker checkpoints are within the seed-to-seed variation measured in `pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json` (see the GitHub README) and should not be interpreted as rankings.

## Deviations from the Source Papers

- **Training regime**: 2,400 gradient steps x 32 utterances (N = 8 speakers x M = 4, ~13.27 epochs) on <= 25 utterances/speaker from 232 speakers (5,788 utterances); the source papers train for ~500k steps with N = 16-64 / M = 8-10 on thousands of speakers.
- **Augmentation**: synthetic log-Mel-domain noise + one-tap smoothing (`specaug.apply_feature_mtr_augmentation`), not waveform MTR with recorded noise/RIR corpora.
- **ECAPA-TDNN**: LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm.
- **Frontend**: 80-D natural-log Mel + frame-level energy VAD (26 dB dynamic range) + CMVN; evaluation centre-crops to at most 500 frames (5 s).
