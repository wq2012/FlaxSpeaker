# FlaxSpeaker: `univ_full_conformer_large_arcface` (`conformer` - `large`)

## Disclaimer & Reproduction Notice

> **This is not an officially supported Google product.**
>
> This checkpoint and the accompanying `FlaxSpeaker` library are a from-scratch re-implementation in JAX/Flax, written using only the published papers (no proprietary code or data), of speaker recognition algorithms from:
> - **GE2E**: *Generalized End-to-End Loss for Speaker Verification* ([arXiv:1710.10467](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10467))
> - **Dr-Vectors**: *Decision Residual Networks and an Improved Loss for Speaker Recognition* ([arXiv:2104.01989](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01989))
> - **ATP** (pooling head repurposed from a *language identification* paper): *Attentive Temporal Pooling for Conformer-based Streaming Language Identification in Long-form Speech* ([arXiv:2202.12163](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12163))
> - **PFAS**: *Parameter-Free Attentive Scoring for Speaker Verification* ([arXiv:2203.05642](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05642))
>
> The original papers were run on Google-internal infrastructure and data; this checkpoint is a **full-data open-corpus universal flagship** trained on **12,193 speakers (464,557 clean utterances + MUSAN/RIR/speed augmentation)** across VoxCeleb2-dev, VoxCeleb1-dev, CN-Celeb 1+2, and LibriSpeech 960h with zero speaker overlap against official evaluation sets.

## Training Budget (read this first)

This flagship model was trained for **4,500 gradient steps** (warmup `150` steps, batch size `64`) over the full multi-corpus universal training pool (VoxCeleb1/2 + CN-Celeb1/2 + LibriSpeech 960h) (12,193 base speakers, 464,557 clean utterances, expanded via 3-way speed perturbation + MUSAN/RIR).

**Training-crop provenance.** This checkpoint was trained with `U(90, 180)`-frame variable-length crops and an exact validity mask (the current pipeline default); the shipped `config.json` / YAML (`variable_length_training: true`) describes the released weights. Step-0 loss fingerprint at the released seed (`scripts/fingerprint_released_checkpoints.py`, `pretrained_models/step0_fingerprints.json`): archived `2.7714`; current code with fixed 180-frame crops `2.6614`, with `U(90, 180)` crops `2.7714` (match: `variable`). Evaluating the released weights with the current code reproduces the archived metrics in `eval_results.json`. At the converged `S_safe` budget, the seed-to-seed standard deviation of pooled 1-utt EER across seeds 0-2 is 0.08-0.41 % absolute (`pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json`), while the 8,000-trial 95 % bootstrap CI half-width is ~0.8 %.

## Model Files Included

- `model.safetensors`: model weights (encoder + GE2E `w,b` / Dr-Vector / PFAS heads) in SafeTensors format
- `flax_model.msgpack`: native Flax Msgpack serialized parameters
- `config.json`: `FlaxSpeakerConfig` (full `ExperimentConfig`, incl. the frontend/VAD settings)
- `eval_results.json`: multi-domain evaluation metrics (1-utt & 3-utt EER, minDCF, ROC-AUC, 95% bootstrap CIs, VoxCeleb1-O 10-speaker subset)
- `model_fp32.tflite` / `model_int8.tflite`: `jax2tf` exports of the **encoder only** with a **fixed, unmasked 180-frame (1.8 s) input window** `[1, 180, 80]` -> `[1, 256]`. All EERs in the main tables below come from full-sequence masked JAX inference (up to 3000 frames / 30 s); the TFLite models see a centre crop and the reported cosine fidelity (>= 0.9999 vs. JAX) was measured on 180-frame inputs.
  - Measured 180-frame TFLite 1-utt EER (VoxCeleb1-O official (37,611 trials, 180-frame center crop)): FP32 **18.46%**, INT8 **18.45%**, mean `cos(FP32, INT8)` = `0.999986` (vs. full-sequence masked JAX: `15.20%`)

## Multi-Domain Evaluation Results

### 1-Utterance Verification Across Evaluation Domains

Trial lists are 50/50 target/impostor over held-out speakers (LibriSpeech 40, CN-Celeb2 30, VoxCeleb1 10 speakers); minDCF@0.01 is close to its trivial ceiling of 1.0 for every model under this trial mix.

| Evaluation Split | Trials | Raw EER (%) | AS-Norm EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | minDCF@0.10 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

| **Universal Macro-Average (3 Domains)** | — | **14.62%** | **14.16%** | — | 0.8644 | 0.6611 | 0.9312 |

### 3-Utterance Multi-Enrollment Verification Across Evaluation Domains

| Evaluation Split | Trials | 3-Utt EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **7.20%** | [5.10, 8.65] | 0.3420 | 0.9854 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **12.90%** | [10.15, 14.40] | 0.8180 | 0.9518 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **12.80%** | [10.65, 14.80] | 0.8220 | 0.9466 |
| **Universal Pooled (3-Utt)** | 3,000 | **11.50%** | [10.13, 12.47] | 0.8520 | 0.9603 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3-Utt)** | — | **10.97%** | — | 0.6607 | 0.9613 |

Single seed; the 95% bootstrap CIs resample trials (not speakers). Differences below about 1% absolute EER between FlaxSpeaker checkpoints are within the seed-to-seed variation measured in `pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json` (see the GitHub README) and should not be interpreted as rankings.

## Deviations from the Source Papers

- **Training regime**: 4,500 gradient steps x 64 utterances (~0.62 epochs) across 12,193 base speakers (464,557 clean utterances + 3x speed perturbation + MUSAN/RIR).
- **Augmentation**: corpus-backed MUSAN environmental noise, music, and multi-speaker babble + RIRS_NOISES room impulse responses + 3-way polyphase speed perturbation (`0.9x`, `1.0x`, `1.1x`) + SpecAugment.
- **Conformer**: parallel linear + Conv1D stem, no positional encoding, 4 blocks x 320-D, 8 heads, kernel 15, mask-aware GroupNorm(2), no dropout, multi-layer feature aggregation; the Google papers use 12 x 512 blocks, 4-8 heads, kernel 32, relative positional encoding and dropout.
- **ATP pooling**: 4 heads with a tanh bottleneck (128-D) and `subspace_heads = True`; the papers use a single head with a linear-sigmoid weight (`attention_dim = 0`). Note that arXiv:2202.12163 is a language-identification paper whose pooling head is repurposed here.
- **Frontend**: 80-D natural-log Mel + frame-level energy VAD (26 dB dynamic range) + CMVN; evaluation processes up to 3000 frames (30.0 s).
