## Training Budget (read this first)

This model was trained to convergence for **2,400 gradient steps** (`S_safe = X + 2 epochs` safety margin, warmup `240` steps) with mini-batches of 32 utterances (8 speakers x 4 utterances), i.e. **~13.27 epochs** over the 5,788-utterance LibriSpeech training pool (232 speakers), on a CPU workstation with seed 42. Across the training trajectory, in-domain LibriSpeech EER progressed from step `400`: **19.43%** (1-utt) / **13.50%** (3-utt) -> step `2000` (knee): **9.73%** (1-utt) / **5.20%** (3-utt) -> step `2400` (final): **9.47%** (1-utt) / **5.60%** (3-utt) (Universal Pooled final: **18.65%** 1-utt / **14.27%** 3-utt). While training loss and validation EER have reached their small-corpus convergence plateau on this 232-speaker open split (<= 25 utterances/speaker), absolute EERs remain bounded by training speaker diversity compared to industrial benchmarks trained on thousands of speakers (see below).

**Training-crop provenance.** This checkpoint was trained with `U(90, 180)`-frame variable-length crops and an exact validity mask (the current pipeline default); the shipped `config.json` / YAML (`variable_length_training: true`) describes the released weights. Step-0 loss fingerprint at the released seed (`scripts/fingerprint_released_checkpoints.py`, `pretrained_models/step0_fingerprints.json`): archived `1.0005`; current code with fixed 180-frame crops `1.0002`, with `U(90, 180)` crops `1.0005` (match: `variable`). Evaluating the released weights with the current code reproduces the archived metrics in `eval_results.json`. At the converged `S_safe` budget, the seed-to-seed standard deviation of pooled 1-utt EER across seeds 0-2 is 0.08-0.41 % absolute (`pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json`), while the 8,000-trial 95 % bootstrap CI half-width is ~0.8 %.

For orientation only: published ECAPA-TDNN systems trained on VoxCeleb2-dev reach about 0.9% EER on the full VoxCeleb1-O list (Desplanques et al., 2020), and sub-1M-parameter systems about 2% (Wang et al., EfficientTDNN, 2022). The checkpoints released here are trained to convergence (including a +2-epoch safety margin) on the self-contained 381-speaker (<=25 utterances/speaker) benchmark corpus rather than VoxCeleb2-dev (5,994 speakers, ~1.1M utterances), and are intended for controlled relative comparisons within the FlaxSpeaker benchmark, not as state-of-the-art models trained on thousand-speaker corpora.

python scripts/inference.py --model_dir wq2012/ls_conformer_small_ge2e_contrast \
    --enroll_audio path/to/enroll.flac --test_audio path/to/test.flac
```

## Multi-Domain Evaluation Results

### 1-Utterance Verification Across Evaluation Domains

Trial lists are 50/50 target/impostor over held-out speakers (LibriSpeech 40, CN-Celeb2 30, VoxCeleb1 10 speakers); minDCF@0.01 is close to its trivial ceiling of 1.0 for every model under this trial mix.

| Evaluation Split | Trials | Raw EER (%) | AS-Norm EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | minDCF@0.10 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (English Read)** | 3,000 | **9.47%** | **9.53%** | [8.53, 10.67] | 0.7940 | 0.4367 | 0.9638 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (Chinese Multi-Genre)** | 3,000 | **26.27%** | **25.90%** | [24.60, 27.80] | 0.8547 | 0.8053 | 0.8168 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (In-the-Wild Celebrity)** | 2,000 | **20.50%** | **20.45%** | [18.62, 22.20] | 0.9460 | 0.8490 | 0.8830 |
| **Universal Pooled (All 3 Domains)** | 8,000 | **18.65%** | **18.86%** | [17.73, 19.49] | 0.8852 | 0.7023 | 0.8952 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3 Domains)** | — | **18.74%** | **18.63%** | — | 0.8649 | 0.6970 | 0.8879 |
| **VoxCeleb1-O 10-speaker subset** (see caveat) | 2,500 | **22.52%** | **22.74%** | [20.59, 24.22] | 0.8742 | 0.7680 | 0.8610 |

Caveat: VoxCeleb1-O **10-speaker subset**: the official `veri_test2.txt` list filtered to trials whose enrollment and test speakers are both among the 10 held-out evaluation speakers (2,500 trials, ~72% target). **Not comparable to published VoxCeleb1-O numbers**; the other 30 of the 40 official test speakers are used as training data by `vox_*` and `univ_*` models.

### 3-Utterance Multi-Enrollment Verification Across Evaluation Domains

| Evaluation Split | Trials | 3-Utt EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **5.60%** | [3.95, 6.80] | 0.4700 | 0.9885 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **22.00%** | [19.00, 24.60] | 0.7320 | 0.8720 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **15.60%** | [12.80, 17.55] | 0.8940 | 0.9265 |
| **Universal Pooled (3-Utt)** | 3,000 | **14.27%** | [12.95, 15.53] | 0.7993 | 0.9374 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3-Utt)** | — | **14.40%** | — | 0.6987 | 0.9290 |

Single seed; the 95% bootstrap CIs resample trials (not speakers). Differences below about 1% absolute EER between FlaxSpeaker checkpoints are within the seed-to-seed variation measured in `pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json` (see the GitHub README) and should not be interpreted as rankings.

## Deviations from the Source Papers

- **Training regime**: 2,400 gradient steps x 32 utterances (N = 8 speakers x M = 4, ~13.27 epochs) on <= 25 utterances/speaker from 232 speakers (5,788 utterances); the source papers train for ~500k steps with N = 16-64 / M = 8-10 on thousands of speakers.
- **Augmentation**: corpus-backed MUSAN environmental noise, music, and multi-speaker babble + RIRS_NOISES room impulse responses + 3-way polyphase speed perturbation (`0.9x`, `1.0x`, `1.1x`) + SpecAugment.
- **Objective**: hybrid contrast surrogate (gradient = 0.25 Eq. 7 + 0.25 BCE + 0.50 softmax-CE) with `ge2e_init_b = -1`, not Wan et al. Eq. 7 alone. Set `ge2e_contrast_surrogate: false` for the pure Eq. 7 gradient.
- **Conformer**: parallel linear + Conv1D stem, no positional encoding, 3 blocks x 192-D, 4 heads, kernel 15, mask-aware GroupNorm(2), no dropout, multi-layer feature aggregation; the Google papers use 12 x 512 blocks, 4-8 heads, kernel 32, relative positional encoding and dropout.
- **ATP pooling**: 4 heads with a tanh bottleneck (128-D) and `subspace_heads = True`; the papers use a single head with a linear-sigmoid weight (`attention_dim = 0`). Note that arXiv:2202.12163 is a language-identification paper whose pooling head is repurposed here.
- **Frontend**: 80-D natural-log Mel + frame-level energy VAD (26 dB dynamic range) + CMVN; evaluation processes up to 3000 frames (30.0 s).
