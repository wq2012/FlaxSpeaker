# FlaxSpeaker: `ls_conformer_small_ext_softmax` (`conformer` - `small`)

## Disclaimer & Reproduction Notice

## Training Budget (read this first)

This model was trained for **400 gradient steps** with mini-batches of 32 utterances (8 speakers x 4 utterances), i.e. about 1.35 epochs over the 9,447-utterance universal corpus, on a CPU workstation, with a single seed (42). Losses are not converged at this budget. All EERs below are therefore far from state of the art and are only meaningful for *relative* comparisons between FlaxSpeaker checkpoints trained under the same budget.

**Training-crop provenance.** This checkpoint was trained with **fixed 180-frame (1.8 s) crops and all-ones validity masks**, not with the `U(90, 180)` variable-length crops that are the current pipeline default: the training code in use at the time defaulted the batchers to `variable_length=False` and the benchmark driver did not pass the flag. The shipped `config.json` / YAML therefore set `variable_length_training: false`, which re-creates this regime. Step-0 loss fingerprint at the released seed (`scripts/fingerprint_released_checkpoints.py`, `pretrained_models/step0_fingerprints.json`): archived `2.0232`; current code with fixed 180-frame crops `2.0232`, with `U(90, 180)` crops `2.0882` (match: `fixed`). Evaluating the released weights with the current code reproduces the archived metrics in `eval_results.json`. The seed-to-seed standard deviation of pooled 1-utt EER at this budget is about 0.7-0.8 % absolute, so sub-1.5 % differences between checkpoints are not rankings.

For orientation only: published ECAPA-TDNN systems trained on VoxCeleb2-dev reach about 0.9% EER on the full VoxCeleb1-O list (Desplanques et al., 2020), and sub-1M-parameter systems about 2% (Wang et al., EfficientTDNN, 2022). The 400-step checkpoints released here are 10-30x worse than that and are intended for relative comparisons within the FlaxSpeaker benchmark, not as state-of-the-art models.

## Model Files Included

- `model.safetensors`: model weights (encoder + GE2E `w,b` / Dr-Vector / PFAS heads) in SafeTensors format
- `flax_model.msgpack`: native Flax Msgpack serialized parameters
- `config.json`: `FlaxSpeakerConfig` (full `ExperimentConfig`, incl. the frontend/VAD settings)
- `eval_results.json`: multi-domain evaluation metrics (1-utt & 3-utt EER, minDCF, ROC-AUC, 95% bootstrap CIs, VoxCeleb1-O 10-speaker subset)

## Quickstart Usage

### Python API (from Hugging Face Hub or Local Directory)

Requires `flaxspeaker >= 0.3.0` (`pip install -U flaxspeaker`); the `0.2.0` wheel on PyPI predates the released checkpoints and cannot load them.

```python
from flaxspeaker import load_pretrained

model = load_pretrained("wq2012/ls_conformer_small_ext_softmax")
emb = model.extract_embedding("path/to/utterance.flac")
score = model.verify("path/to/enroll.flac", "path/to/test.flac")
print(f"Embedding shape: {emb.shape}, Verification score: {score:.4f}")
```

### Command-Line Inference

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --model_dir wq2012/ls_conformer_small_ext_softmax \
    --enroll_audio path/to/enroll.flac --test_audio path/to/test.flac
```

## Multi-Domain Evaluation Results

### 1-Utterance Verification Across Evaluation Domains

Trial lists are 50/50 target/impostor over held-out speakers (LibriSpeech 40, CN-Celeb2 30, VoxCeleb1 10 speakers); minDCF@0.01 is close to its trivial ceiling of 1.0 for every model under this trial mix.

| Evaluation Split | Trials | EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | minDCF@0.10 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (English Read)** | 3,000 | **10.03%** | [9.10, 11.12] | 0.7967 | 0.5493 | 0.9604 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (Chinese Multi-Genre)** | 3,000 | **29.87%** | [28.03, 31.40] | 0.9593 | 0.9233 | 0.7851 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (In-the-Wild Celebrity)** | 2,000 | **24.10%** | [22.35, 25.95] | 0.9490 | 0.8890 | 0.8446 |
| **Universal Pooled (All 3 Domains)** | 8,000 | **21.05%** | [20.11, 21.93] | 0.9555 | 0.8115 | 0.8779 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3 Domains)** | — | **21.33%** | — | 0.9017 | 0.7872 | 0.8634 |
| **VoxCeleb1-O 10-speaker subset** (see caveat) | 2,500 | **26.43%** | [24.56, 28.43] | 0.9631 | 0.9228 | 0.8133 |

Caveat: VoxCeleb1-O **10-speaker subset**: the official `veri_test2.txt` list filtered to trials whose enrollment and test speakers are both among the 10 held-out evaluation speakers (2,500 trials, ~72% target). **Not comparable to published VoxCeleb1-O numbers**; the other 30 of the 40 official test speakers are used as training data by `vox_*` and `univ_*` models.

### 3-Utterance Multi-Enrollment Verification Across Evaluation Domains

| Evaluation Split | Trials | 3-Utt EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **6.20%** | [4.65, 7.55] | 0.4980 | 0.9846 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **25.50%** | [22.95, 28.50] | 0.9120 | 0.8314 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **20.20%** | [18.00, 22.75] | 0.9420 | 0.8820 |
| **Universal Pooled (3-Utt)** | 3,000 | **17.53%** | [16.20, 18.73] | 0.8853 | 0.9114 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3-Utt)** | — | **17.30%** | — | 0.7840 | 0.8993 |

Single seed; the 95% bootstrap CIs resample trials (not speakers). Differences below about 1% absolute EER between FlaxSpeaker checkpoints are within the seed-to-seed variation measured in `pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json` (see the GitHub README) and should not be interpreted as rankings.

## Deviations from the Source Papers

- **Training regime**: 400 gradient steps x 32 utterances (N = 8 speakers x M = 4) on <= 25 utterances/speaker from 381 (universal) or fewer speakers; the source papers train for ~500k steps with N = 16-64 / M = 8-10 on thousands of speakers.
- **Augmentation**: synthetic log-Mel-domain noise + one-tap smoothing (`specaug.apply_feature_mtr_augmentation`), not waveform MTR with recorded noise/RIR corpora.
- **Objective**: 50/50 blend of row-softmax and `-log N`-shifted extended-set softmax; the paper's pure Eq. 2 is available via `pure_extended_set: true`.
- **Conformer**: parallel linear + Conv1D stem, no positional encoding, 3 blocks x 192-D, 4 heads, kernel 15, mask-aware GroupNorm(2), no dropout, multi-layer feature aggregation; the Google papers use 12 x 512 blocks, 4-8 heads, kernel 32, relative positional encoding and dropout.
- **ATP pooling**: 4 heads with a tanh bottleneck (128-D) and `subspace_heads = True`; the papers use a single head with a linear-sigmoid weight (`attention_dim = 0`). Note that arXiv:2202.12163 is a language-identification paper whose pooling head is repurposed here.
- **Frontend**: 80-D natural-log Mel + frame-level energy VAD (26 dB dynamic range) + CMVN; evaluation centre-crops to at most 500 frames (5 s).
