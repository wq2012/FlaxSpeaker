> The experiments in those papers were run on Google-internal infrastructure and data, not with this library. **This is a converged small-corpus benchmark checkpoint (4,600 steps / ~15.58 epochs on 9,447 utterances from 381 speakers), not a full-corpus reproduction of the papers' large-scale results** -- see *Training budget* and *Deviations from the source papers* below.

## Training Budget (read this first)

This model was trained to convergence for **4,600 gradient steps** (`S_safe = X + 2 epochs` safety margin, warmup `460` steps) with mini-batches of 32 utterances (8 speakers x 4 utterances), i.e. **~15.58 epochs** over the 9,447-utterance 3-domain controlled training pool (381 speakers), on a CPU workstation with seed 42. Across the training trajectory, Universal Pooled EER progressed from step `400`: **25.40%** (1-utt) / **22.33%** (3-utt) -> step `4000` (knee): **17.85%** (1-utt) / **14.87%** (3-utt) -> step `4600` (final): **17.60%** (1-utt) / **14.70%** (3-utt). While training loss and validation EER have reached their small-corpus convergence plateau on this 381-speaker open split (<= 25 utterances/speaker), absolute EERs remain bounded by training speaker diversity compared to industrial benchmarks trained on thousands of speakers (see below).

**Training-crop provenance.** This checkpoint was trained with `U(90, 180)`-frame variable-length crops and an exact validity mask (the current pipeline default); the shipped `config.json` / YAML (`variable_length_training: true`) describes the released weights. Step-0 loss fingerprint at the released seed (`scripts/fingerprint_released_checkpoints.py`, `pretrained_models/step0_fingerprints.json`): archived `2.1066`; current code with fixed 180-frame crops `2.2174`, with `U(90, 180)` crops `2.1066` (match: `variable`). Evaluating the released weights with the current code reproduces the archived metrics in `eval_results.json`. At the converged `S_safe` budget, the seed-to-seed standard deviation of pooled 1-utt EER across seeds 0-2 is 0.08-0.41 % absolute (`pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json`), while the 8,000-trial 95 % bootstrap CI half-width is ~0.8 %.

For orientation only: published ECAPA-TDNN systems trained on VoxCeleb2-dev reach about 0.9% EER on the full VoxCeleb1-O list (Desplanques et al., 2020), and sub-1M-parameter systems about 2% (Wang et al., EfficientTDNN, 2022). The checkpoints released here are trained to convergence (including a +2-epoch safety margin) on the self-contained 381-speaker (<=25 utterances/speaker) benchmark corpus rather than VoxCeleb2-dev (5,994 speakers, ~1.1M utterances), and are intended for controlled relative comparisons within the FlaxSpeaker benchmark, not as state-of-the-art models trained on thousand-speaker corpora.

emb = model.extract_embedding("path/to/utterance.flac")
score = model.verify("path/to/enroll.flac", "path/to/test.flac")
print(f"Embedding shape: {emb.shape}, Verification score: {score:.4f}")
```

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --model_dir wq2012/univ_conformer_small_pfas \
    --enroll_audio path/to/enroll.flac --test_audio path/to/test.flac
```

## Multi-Domain Evaluation Results

### 1-Utterance Verification Across Evaluation Domains

Trial lists are 50/50 target/impostor over held-out speakers (LibriSpeech 40, CN-Celeb2 30, VoxCeleb1 10 speakers); minDCF@0.01 is close to its trivial ceiling of 1.0 for every model under this trial mix.

| Evaluation Split | Trials | EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | minDCF@0.10 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (English Read)** | 3,000 | **11.73%** | [10.53, 12.93] | 0.7467 | 0.5173 | 0.9547 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (Chinese Multi-Genre)** | 3,000 | **20.93%** | [19.62, 22.40] | 0.9180 | 0.7887 | 0.8723 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (In-the-Wild Celebrity)** | 2,000 | **19.45%** | [17.77, 21.23] | 0.9530 | 0.7990 | 0.8839 |
| **Universal Pooled (All 3 Domains)** | 8,000 | **17.60%** | [16.80, 18.50] | 0.8768 | 0.7032 | 0.9066 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3 Domains)** | — | **17.37%** | — | 0.8726 | 0.7017 | 0.9036 |
| **VoxCeleb1-O 10-speaker subset** (see caveat) | 2,500 | **22.52%** | [20.73, 24.71] | 0.9542 | 0.8311 | 0.8682 |

Caveat: VoxCeleb1-O **10-speaker subset**: the official `veri_test2.txt` list filtered to trials whose enrollment and test speakers are both among the 10 held-out evaluation speakers (2,500 trials, ~72% target). **Not comparable to published VoxCeleb1-O numbers**; the other 30 of the 40 official test speakers are used as training data by `vox_*` and `univ_*` models.

### 3-Utterance Multi-Enrollment Verification Across Evaluation Domains

| Evaluation Split | Trials | 3-Utt EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **8.10%** | [6.40, 10.11] | 0.5460 | 0.9768 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **18.80%** | [16.10, 20.95] | 0.8820 | 0.9065 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **16.20%** | [13.75, 18.50] | 0.8540 | 0.9220 |
| **Universal Pooled (3-Utt)** | 3,000 | **14.70%** | [13.42, 16.02] | 0.8327 | 0.9364 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3-Utt)** | — | **14.37%** | — | 0.7607 | 0.9351 |

Single seed; the 95% bootstrap CIs resample trials (not speakers). Differences below about 1% absolute EER between FlaxSpeaker checkpoints are within the seed-to-seed variation measured in `pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json` (see the GitHub README) and should not be interpreted as rankings.

## Deviations from the Source Papers

- **Training regime**: 4,600 gradient steps x 32 utterances (N = 8 speakers x M = 4, ~15.58 epochs) on <= 25 utterances/speaker from 381 speakers (9,447 utterances); the source papers train for ~500k steps with N = 16-64 / M = 8-10 on thousands of speakers.
- **Augmentation**: corpus-backed MUSAN environmental noise, music, and multi-speaker babble + RIRS_NOISES room impulse responses + 3-way polyphase speed perturbation (`0.9x`, `1.0x`, `1.1x`) + SpecAugment.
- **Objective**: 50/50 blend of row-softmax and `-log N`-shifted extended-set softmax; the paper's pure Eq. 2 is available via `pure_extended_set: true`.
- **PFAS head**: `shared_nonlinear` multi-head tanh frame attention with a global ATP anchor and 4 keys x (32 + 128) (FlaxSpeaker 'PFAS-SN'); the paper uses ATP -> affine+ReLU -> linear with 32 tied keys (`odyssey2022_pfas_config(pure_paper_mode=True)`).
- **Conformer**: parallel linear + Conv1D stem, no positional encoding, 3 blocks x 192-D, 4 heads, kernel 15, mask-aware GroupNorm(2), no dropout, multi-layer feature aggregation; the Google papers use 12 x 512 blocks, 4-8 heads, kernel 32, relative positional encoding and dropout.
- **Frontend**: 80-D natural-log Mel + frame-level energy VAD (26 dB dynamic range) + CMVN; evaluation processes up to 3000 frames (30.0 s).
