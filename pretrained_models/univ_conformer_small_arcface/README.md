> The experiments in those papers were run on Google-internal infrastructure and data, not with this library. **This is a converged small-corpus benchmark checkpoint (4,600 steps / ~31.16 epochs on 9,447 utterances from 381 speakers), not a full-corpus reproduction of the papers' large-scale results** -- see *Training budget* and *Deviations from the source papers* below.

## Training Budget (read this first)

This model was trained to convergence for **4,600 gradient steps** (`S_safe = X + 2 epochs` safety margin, warmup `460` steps) with mini-batches of 64 utterances (8 speakers x 4 utterances), i.e. **~31.16 epochs** over the 9,447-utterance 3-domain controlled training pool (381 speakers), on a CPU workstation with seed 42. Angular margin warmup is linearly ramped over the first `500` steps (`margin_warmup_steps`) before holding the target margin. Across the training trajectory, Universal Pooled EER progressed from step `400`: **28.12%** (1-utt) / **24.93%** (3-utt) -> step `4000` (knee): **14.59%** (1-utt) / **10.00%** (3-utt) -> step `4600` (final): **14.80%** (1-utt) / **10.10%** (3-utt). While training loss and validation EER have reached their small-corpus convergence plateau on this 381-speaker open split (<= 25 utterances/speaker), absolute EERs remain bounded by training speaker diversity compared to industrial benchmarks trained on thousands of speakers (see below).

**Training-crop provenance.** This checkpoint was trained with `U(90, 180)`-frame variable-length crops and an exact validity mask (the current pipeline default); the shipped `config.json` / YAML (`variable_length_training: true`) describes the released weights. Step-0 loss fingerprint at the released seed (`scripts/fingerprint_released_checkpoints.py`, `pretrained_models/step0_fingerprints.json`): archived `9.3033`; current code with fixed 180-frame crops `9.1251`, with `U(90, 180)` crops `9.3033` (match: `variable`). Evaluating the released weights with the current code reproduces the archived metrics in `eval_results.json`. At the converged `S_safe` budget, the seed-to-seed standard deviation of pooled 1-utt EER across seeds 0-2 is 0.08-0.41 % absolute (`pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json`), while the 8,000-trial 95 % bootstrap CI half-width is ~0.8 %.

For orientation only: published ECAPA-TDNN systems trained on VoxCeleb2-dev reach about 0.9% EER on the full VoxCeleb1-O list (Desplanques et al., 2020), and sub-1M-parameter systems about 2% (Wang et al., EfficientTDNN, 2022). The checkpoints released here are trained to convergence (including a +2-epoch safety margin) on the self-contained 381-speaker (<=25 utterances/speaker) benchmark corpus rather than VoxCeleb2-dev (5,994 speakers, ~1.1M utterances), and are intended for controlled relative comparisons within the FlaxSpeaker benchmark, not as state-of-the-art models trained on thousand-speaker corpora.

### Python API (from Hugging Face Hub or Local Directory)

Requires `flaxspeaker >= 0.5.0` (`pip install -U flaxspeaker`).

```python
from flaxspeaker import load_pretrained

model = load_pretrained("wq2012/univ_conformer_small_arcface")
emb = model.extract_embedding("path/to/utterance.flac")
score = model.verify("path/to/enroll.flac", "path/to/test.flac")
print(f"Embedding shape: {emb.shape}, Verification score: {score:.4f}")
```

### Command-Line Inference

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --model_dir wq2012/univ_conformer_small_arcface \
    --enroll_audio path/to/enroll.flac --test_audio path/to/test.flac
```

## Multi-Domain Evaluation Results

### 1-Utterance Verification Across Evaluation Domains

Trial lists are 50/50 target/impostor over held-out speakers (LibriSpeech 40, CN-Celeb2 30, VoxCeleb1 10 speakers); minDCF@0.01 is close to its trivial ceiling of 1.0 for every model under this trial mix.

| Evaluation Split | Trials | Raw EER (%) | AS-Norm EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | minDCF@0.10 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (English Read)** | 3,000 | **8.27%** | **6.97%** | [7.23, 9.32] | 0.4647 | 0.3467 | 0.9727 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (Chinese Multi-Genre)** | 3,000 | **16.93%** | **16.20%** | [15.42, 18.20] | 0.8593 | 0.6600 | 0.9150 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (In-the-Wild Celebrity)** | 2,000 | **18.05%** | **17.40%** | [16.40, 19.93] | 0.7590 | 0.7030 | 0.9149 |
| **Universal Pooled (All 3 Domains)** | 8,000 | **14.80%** | **13.28%** | [13.93, 15.47] | 0.7135 | 0.5580 | 0.9381 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3 Domains)** | — | **14.42%** | **13.52%** | — | 0.6943 | 0.5699 | 0.9342 |
| **VoxCeleb1-O 10-speaker subset** (see caveat) | 2,500 | **19.53%** | **17.97%** | [17.83, 21.14] | 0.7390 | 0.7361 | 0.9010 |

Caveat: VoxCeleb1-O **10-speaker subset**: the official `veri_test2.txt` list filtered to trials whose enrollment and test speakers are both among the 10 held-out evaluation speakers (2,500 trials, ~72% target). **Not comparable to published VoxCeleb1-O numbers**; the other 30 of the 40 official test speakers are used as training data by `vox_*` and `univ_*` models.

### 3-Utterance Multi-Enrollment Verification Across Evaluation Domains

| Evaluation Split | Trials | 3-Utt EER (%) | 95% Bootstrap CI (%) | minDCF@0.01 | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **LibriSpeech (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **4.60%** | [3.20, 5.80] | 0.2760 | 0.9905 |
| **CN-Celeb2 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **12.60%** | [10.20, 14.20] | 0.7860 | 0.9537 |
| **VoxCeleb1 (3-Utt)** | 1,000 | **12.30%** | [10.45, 14.75] | 0.8700 | 0.9457 |
| **Universal Pooled (3-Utt)** | 3,000 | **10.10%** | [8.96, 11.23] | 0.7387 | 0.9661 |
| **Universal Macro-Average (3-Utt)** | — | **9.83%** | — | 0.6440 | 0.9633 |

Single seed; the 95% bootstrap CIs resample trials (not speakers). Differences below about 1% absolute EER between FlaxSpeaker checkpoints are within the seed-to-seed variation measured in `pretrained_models/r2_seed_and_control_results.json` (see the GitHub README) and should not be interpreted as rankings.

## Deviations from the Source Papers

- **Training regime**: 4,600 gradient steps x 64 utterances (N = 8 speakers x M = 4, ~31.16 epochs) on <= 25 utterances/speaker from 381 speakers (9,447 utterances); the source papers train for ~500k steps with N = 16-64 / M = 8-10 on thousands of speakers.
- **Augmentation**: corpus-backed MUSAN environmental noise, music, and multi-speaker babble + RIRS_NOISES room impulse responses + 3-way polyphase speed perturbation (`0.9x`, `1.0x`, `1.1x`) + SpecAugment.
- **Conformer**: parallel linear + Conv1D stem, no positional encoding, 3 blocks x 192-D, 4 heads, kernel 15, mask-aware GroupNorm(2), no dropout, multi-layer feature aggregation; the Google papers use 12 x 512 blocks, 4-8 heads, kernel 32, relative positional encoding and dropout.
- **ATP pooling**: 4 heads with a tanh bottleneck (128-D) and `subspace_heads = True`; the papers use a single head with a linear-sigmoid weight (`attention_dim = 0`). Note that arXiv:2202.12163 is a language-identification paper whose pooling head is repurposed here.
- **Frontend**: 80-D natural-log Mel + frame-level energy VAD (26 dB dynamic range) + CMVN; evaluation processes up to 3000 frames (30.0 s).
